## API Documentation

This section explains how to use the API to create a payment via the TZSMM Pay gateway.

### API Endpoint: `/api/payment/create`

**URL**: `https://tzsmmpay.com/api/payment/create`

**Method**: `GET`

### Required Parameters

To create a payment, send the following parameters in the API request:

- `api_key`: Your TZSMM Pay API key.
- `cus_name`: The name of the customer (e.g., "Demo User").
- `cus_email`: The email of the customer (e.g., "demo@demo.com").
- `cus_number`: The phone number of the customer (e.g., "01700000000").
- `amount`: The payment amount (e.g., "1" for 1 unit of currency).
- `success_url`: The URL to redirect the user to after a successful payment (e.g., `https://domain.com/success-url`).
- `cancel_url`: The URL to redirect the user to if they cancel the payment (e.g., `https://domain.com/cancel-url/dashboard`).
- `callback_url`: The URL where payment status will be sent (e.g., `https://domain.com/callback-url`).

### Example Request

```php
use Tzsmmpay\TzsmmpayClient;
use Tzsmmpay\TzsmmpayResponse;

$apiKey = 'xOevYGbzFmJCm1rkzDrf';  // Your API key

$tzsmm = new TzsmmpayClient($apiKey);

$paymentData = [
    'cus_name' => 'Demo User',
    'cus_email' => 'demo@demo.com',
    'cus_number' => '01700000000',
    'amount' => 1,
    'success_url' => 'https://domain.com/success-url',
    'cancel_url' => 'https://domain.com/cancel-url/dashboard',
    'callback_url' => 'https://domain.com/callback-url',
];

$response = $tzsmm->createPayment($paymentData);

if ($response->isSuccess()) {
    echo "Payment created successfully!";
    echo "Transaction ID: " . $response->getData()['transaction_id'];
    echo "Payment URL: " . $response->getData()['payment_url'];
} else {
    echo "Error: " . $response->getMessage();
}
```

### Example Response

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "transaction_id": "trx_123456",
        "payment_url": "https://tzsmmpay.com/payment/trx_123456"
    },
    "message": null
}
```

---

## Verify Payment

After a customer has completed their payment, you can verify the payment using the `verifyPayment` method.

### API Endpoint: `/api/payment/verify/{transaction_id}`

**URL**: `https://tzsmmpay.com/api/payment/verify/{transaction_id}`

**Method**: `GET`

### Example Verification Request

```php
$transactionId = 'trx_123456';  // Replace with actual transaction ID

$response = $tzsmm->verifyPayment($transactionId);

if ($response->isSuccess()) {
    echo "Payment verified successfully!";
    print_r($response->getData());  // Shows payment status and details
} else {
    echo "Verification failed: " . $response->getMessage();
}
```

### Example Verification Response

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "status": "Completed",
        "amount": 1,
        "cus_name": "Demo User",
        "cus_email": "demo@demo.com",
        "cus_number": "01700000000"
    },
    "message": null
}
```

## Error Handling

In case of an error, the API will return an error message in the `message` field of the response. Handle errors accordingly in your application:

```php
if (!$response->isSuccess()) {
    echo "Error: " . $response->getMessage();
}
```
