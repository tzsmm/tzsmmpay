use Tzsmmpay\Tzsmmpay;

$tzsmm = new Tzsmmpay([
    'api_key' => 'YOUR_API_KEY',  // Replace with your TZSMM Pay API key
    'api_secret' => 'YOUR_API_SECRET'  // Replace with your API secret
]);

$response = $tzsmm->createPayment([
    'amount' => 100,  // The payment amount
    'currency' => 'USD',  // Currency code
    'payment_method' => 'credit_card',  // Payment method
    'callback_url' => 'https://yourwebsite.com/callback'  // URL for payment status callback
]);

echo $response;
```

### Verify a Payment
Use the `verifyPayment` method to verify the status of a payment:

```php
$response = $tzsmm->verifyPayment('payment_id');

echo $response;
```
